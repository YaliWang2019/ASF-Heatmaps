- send a email/create a meeting time with Greg
- need to make sure that Greg is good with our proposal
	- did we include creating a heatmap in our proposal?

- how do we interact with the user on what properties to use to create the heatmap
- we need to make sure with Greg what type or property he is interested in us creating a heatmap for.
	- from here we will gather items to 

- introduction
	- we need to be sharing and telling what question we will exactly be asking and answering in technically terms.
	- then, how are we getting this info
	

- need to come up wihth a question for what type of heatmap exactly we need to create
- what properties are required to create this heatmap

- note a three dimentional heatmap if possible although two dimentional is main goal
- need to update with platform for which to use.

1. talk to greg
2. get our question: what is the content of the heatmap which we are hoping to answer
3. figure out what property or what kind of data we actually need to answer the question
